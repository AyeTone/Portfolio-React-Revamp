                The shade room at work just got a bit darker... Use this UI to
                look up the stats of your co-workers GitHub account. That's if
                they are willing to share their username! I'm sure the detective
                in you will find it.

                A CLONE?!?!? I know what you're thinking, he probably followed a
                tutorial on youtube... you are 100% correct. I won't lie, I
                coded along with a youtube to make this. HOWEVER! I did learn a
                good bit about the tech used to make it. I am not a copy paste
                warrior!<small>{"(StackOver RN ðŸ‘€)"}</small>... all the time...
