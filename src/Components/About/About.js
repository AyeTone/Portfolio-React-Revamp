            Hello! My name is Troy Richards, and I am what some would call a{" "}

              if they don't call me that, they don't know about me. Don't worry
              about them, we talking about me.

            If you couldn't tell from the AMAZING animations so far, I love to
            create websites/apps that look and feel amazing to use. I mainly
            work with <span className="skills-used">react</span> and{" "}
            <span className="skills-used">sass</span> but don't mind branching
            out for the right opportunity.

            but I would be happy if you read it. About me as a person, I am a
            gamer. I like to play games in my spare time, mainly moba's
            {"(SMITE!!!)"}. In my spare, I use to make use of my degree in audio
            production and make music. However, when covid hit, I had to sell a
            lot of my equipment and that made me very say :(. My dream is to be
            able to buy my equipment back {"(over even better equipment)"} and
            go back to producing in my spare time. But enough about that, let's
            move on to what you're really here for!
