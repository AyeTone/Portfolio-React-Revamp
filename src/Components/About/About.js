            Hello! My name is Troy Richards, and I am, what some would call, a{" "}
            <br /> <span className="shake">ðŸŽ‰</span>{" "}
            <b className="skills-used about-title">Frontend Developer!!!!!!</b>{" "}

              if they don't call me that, they don't know about me. Don't worry
              about them, we're talking about me.

            If you couldn't tell from the AMAZING animations so far, I love to
            create websites/apps that look and feel amazing to use. I mainly
            work with <span className="skills-used">react</span> and{" "}
            <span className="skills-used">sass</span> but don't mind branching
            out for the right opportunity.

              You can skip this chunk if you're pressed for time,
            </b>{" "}
            but I would be happy if you read it. Let's talk about me as a
            person. I like to play games in my spare time, mainly moba's
            {"(SMITE!!!)"} and my favorite role is jungle. Don't ever ask me to
            play support. Just don't. Another thing about me is I use to make
            use of my degree in audio production and make music. However, when
            covid hit, I had to sell a lot of my equipment and that made me very
            sad :(. My dream is to be able to buy my equipment back{" "}
            {"(over even better equipment)"} and go back to producing in my
            spare time. But enough about that, let's move on to what you're
            really here for!
