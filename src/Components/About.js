                From a young age, I've always been a very heavy gamer. It was, and still somewhat is, 
                one of my favorite pass time activities. This hobby of mine led me to be very interested in the tech
                side of the world as I wanted to create and share my own game one day. Whenever I had free time,
                I would try to learn skills online that would help me achieve that goal which then led me
                to find a new passion in learning how to code various languages.
