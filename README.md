# Portfolio-React-Revamp

This is a Revamp of my portfolio site. As I learned new things, I realized that my portfolio(previous) was looking a little rusty and didn't compare to my current skills. I am not a designer, so I took to the web to see if I could find any frontend portfolios Tha I believed that I could recreate into my own React app. After searching for a while, I came upon Brittany Chiang's website in a blog post of the top 20 portfolio websites. From there, I took the next three days rebuilding my portfolio site while using Brittiay's as a reference for design and layout.  


Although I have completed this build, I still return to it to refactor code with new knowledge that I learn along the way.
